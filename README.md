# Module3-Twist-ACLED

This project focuses on analysis of ACLED (Armed Conflict Location Events Data Project) dataset. The objectives for the project are:

1. Create a web application for ACLED data exploratory data analysis.
2. Create a web application for a knowledge graph based on ACLED dataset.

**NB**: Reasoning behind creating 2 applications rather than 1 was to improve latency and time taken to reload the interactive independent dashboard sections. An accompanying video for the web app demos can be found on the Google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wb351y-EaWjTnjRCOojVtcNHE4CiUY2e).
